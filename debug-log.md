## Debug log

#Friday Nov. 16 

Received parts and tested everything with Arduino Nano. Everything was working as expected 
however ran into some hardware issues after rewiring. Tested BNO055 sensor with Nano and had issues with sensor
not being read on serial monitor. Attached it to a Uno and had no problems. I believe this to be a breadboard problem, 
however I must get another breadboard before continuing. I am running my OLED screen and BNO055 sensor off an Uno for now

Coding wise, I was able to sit and focus for two whole days and compile my code for the project. I was able to look at
some examples of using sensor data to be generated on an OLED, however the cube code was a bit trickier. I ran into some syntax
issues but Colin the lab monitor was able to help me out. These problems dealt with using a "do while" loop, I just 
forgot to put the "do" in my code. Everything is running smoothly so far, however I need to make some adjustments to the 
math once I have my finalized hardware components figured out for the head-mounted unit. I am sure I will be using this log
quite a bit for that portion.
